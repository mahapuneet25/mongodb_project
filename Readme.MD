# Quality Control in Manufacturing

Quality control in manufacturing is a critical process that ensures products meet predefined standards and specifications. It involves the inspection and testing of materials and products at various stages of production to identify and correct defects. Effective QC helps in managing costs, reducing waste, and maintaining brand reputation by preventing the distribution of defective products.

## Key Points:-

### QC is reactive, focusing on defect detection after production, while QA is proactive, aiming to prevent defects before they occur.
### Collecting data on part quality is essential for auditing production processes and ensuring adherence to standardized work instructions.
### QC may involve digital calipers, automated inspection systems, and statistical process control tools to measure and maintain quality.
